# Configuring GKE-Native Monitoring and Logging

- Use Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to view cluster and workload metrics
- Use Cloud Monitoring Alerting to receive notifications about the clusterâ€™s health

## Using Kubernetes Engine Monitoring

Google Kubernetes Engine includes managed support for Monitoring.

In this task, you will create a new cluster with Kubernetes Engine  Monitoring support and then perform typical monitoring tasks using the  Kubernetes Engine monitoring and logging interface.

### Configuring a GKE cluster with Kubernetes Engine Monitoring

```sh
student_01_ceb2542405cf@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-02-23e581467e33)$ history 
    1  export my_zone=us-central1-c
    2  export my_cluster=standard-cluster-1
    3  source <(kubectl completion bash)
    4  gcloud container clusters create $my_cluster    --num-nodes 3 --enable-ip-alias --zone $my_zone     --logging=SYSTEM    --monitoring=SYSTEM
    5  gcloud container clusters get-credentials $my_cluster --zone $my_zone
    6  export my_zone=us-central1-c
    7  export my_cluster=standard-cluster-1
    8  export my_zone=us-central1-c
    9  gcloud container clusters get-credentials $my_cluster --zone $my_zone
   10  history 
student_01_ceb2542405cf@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-02-23e581467e33)$ 
```





### Deploy a sample workload to your GKE cluster

You will now deploy a sample workload to the default namespace of  your GKE cluster. This workload consists of a deployment of three pods  running a simple Hello World demo application. Later in this lab  exercise, you will be able to monitor the health of this workload in  Monitoring.

```sh
student_01_ceb2542405cf@cloudshell:~ (qwiklabs-gcp-02-23e581467e33)$ git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst

```

### Deploy the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test application

You will now deploy the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test application to the  default namespace of your GKE cluster. This workload has a deployment  consisting of a single pod that is then exposed to the internet via a  LoadBalancer service.

In the Cloud Shell, execute the following command to build the Docker  image for the load testing application and push the image to the Google **gcr.io** registry for your lab project:

Alternatively, you can also use Docker directly to build and push an image to **gcr.io**:

`docker build -t gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/gcp-gke-monitor-test .`

```sh
student_01_ceb2542405cf@cloudshell:~/ak8s/Monitoring (qwiklabs-gcp-02-23e581467e33)$ kubectl create -f hello-v2.yaml
deployment.apps/hello-v2 created

## Using the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test application

In this task, you will use the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test application to  explore different aspects of Kubernetes Engine Monitoring. The tool is  composed of four sections:

- Generate CPU Load
- Custom Metrics
- Log Test
- Crash the Pod

n the first section, **Generate CPU Load**, you have  buttons to start and stop a CPU Load Generator. The tool starts a loop  of math operations which will consume an entire CPU core. To prevent  losing control of the pod due to CPU saturation, the loop yields the  processor periodically for 100 nanoseconds. This allows you to quickly  stop the CPU Load Generator without killing the pod.

The second section, **Custom Metrics**, allows you to  explore custom metric monitoring within Cloud Monitoring. When you click Start Monitoring, the tool first creates the necessary Custom Metric  Descriptor, and then starts a loop which sends the custom metric values  to Monitoring every 60 seconds. The custom metrics coded into this tool  are designed to simulate an application that can keep track of the  number of active users connected, and then report that number to an  external service.

To take advantage of these custom metrics, some additional  instrumentation may be required within your application's code. In this  lab exercise you can simulate users connecting and disconnecting by  clicking the Increase and Decrease Users buttons.

Also keep in mind that although the web tool will allow you to change the number of users in real time (just as users may connect and  disconnect in real life), the Cloud Monitoring APIs only allow the tool  to send its current value once per minute. This means your Cloud  Monitoring charts will not reflect changes which occur between the  per-minute updates.

The third section, **Log Test**, allows you to send  different text strings to the container's standard output (the console), which is then periodically collected by Cloud Monitoring and stored as  log messages associated with the pod and container. You can optionally  enable Debug-level logging to see more entries in the logs. This will  allow you to see messages in the logs when you increase the number of  users in the Custom Metrics section, or when you enable or disable the  CPU Load Generator. Note that these logs are sent in plain-text format  to simulate legacy applications which do not support JSON formatted  messages. When you view the logs in Logging you will notice that your  pod's JSON-based Kubernetes event logs have much more robust filtering  and querying options than what is available for the unstructured logs.

The fourth and final section, **Crash the Pod**, allows  you to crash the pod with the click of a button. The tool executes a  section of code with an unhandled error, which crashes the pod and  triggers the deployment to restart a new pod in its place. You can use  this tool to see how quickly Kubernetes Engine can recover from errors.  It is also an opportunity to see the loss of session state in action  because each pod maintains its own session instead of storing it in a  central location. When the pod restarts, all your toggle buttons and  settings return to their default values.

### Start the CPU Load Generator

You will now open a web browser, connect to the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool, and start the CPU load generator.

In the **Generate CPU Load** section, click the **Start CPU Load** button. Note that the STATUS text will change when the load generator starts running.



### Start collecting custom metrics

You will now start a process within the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool  which creates a Custom Metric Descriptor within Cloud Monitoring. Later, when the tool begins sending the custom metric data, Monitoring will  associate the data with this metric descriptor. Note that Monitoring can often automatically create the custom metric descriptors for you when  you send the custom metric data, but creating the descriptor manually  gives you more control over the text that appears in the Monitoring  interface, making it easier for you to find your data in the Metric  Explorer.

1. In the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool, in the **Custom Metrics** section, click the **Start Monitoring** button.

ou can now click the Increase and Decrease Users buttons to change the Current User Count displayed below the STATUS text.

1. Click **Increase Users Counter** and repeat until the **Current User Count** is set to 10 users.

![Highlighted Increase Users Counter and Decrease Users Counter buttons. The Current User Count equals zero.](https://cdn.qwiklabs.com/74HpCYGawU%2Bh5v89rD%2FdjOca%2F3X%2FxsxJPB3BuOdSDek%3D) 

It may take 2-3 minutes for the first data point to appear in  Monitoring. You will check this custom metric in Cloud Monitoring in a  later step.

### Generate test log messages

You will now use the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool to create sample text-based logs which you will later view in Cloud Monitoring.

In the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool, in the **Log Test** section, click the **Enable Debug Logging** button to increase the number of logs the tool generates.

Click the other four log entry buttons to generate some additional  sample log messages. It's important to select a variety of severity  levels so that you can see how the different message types are displayed in Monitoring.

## Using Kubernetes Engine Monitoring

In this task, you will use Kubernetes Engine Monitoring to view the  current health of your GKE cluster and the two workloads running on it.

### Create a Monitoring workspace

You will now setup a Monitoring workspace that's tied to your Google  Cloud Project. The following steps create a new account that has a free  trial of Monitoring.

1. In the Cloud Console, click on **Navigation menu** > **Monitoring**.

### Review the Kubernetes Engine monitoring interface

You will now open and browse the three different sections of the  Kubernetes Engine Monitoring interface. The three sections are:  Infrastructure, Workloads, and Services.

**Note:**  The **GKE** option might not appear immediately in the  Monitoring menus. It might take 5 to 10 minutes to enable the cluster  for the new features. Refresh your page periodically until the option  appears.

#### Examine each section in the interface:

- The **Clusters**, **Nodes**, and **Pods** sections allow you to check the health of particular elements in the  cluster. You can also use this to inspect the pods which are running on a particular node in the cluster.
- To see the details of your cluster, click on the cluster element.
- The **Workloads** section is very helpful, especially when looking for workloads which do not have services exposed.
- The **Kubernetes services** section organizes the  services configured in your environment by cluster, then by namespace  (the administrative barrier or partition within the cluster), and then  shows the various services available to users within that namespace. You can see more details on each service by clicking on their name.
- The **Namespaces** section shows the list of namespaces within the cluster.

The monitoring interface can provide even more detail about the deployments and pods.

You now have a dashboard showing a single chart with a standard  Monitoring metric. Next, you will create a chart for our custom  Monitoring metric and then add it to this dashboard.

1. Click **Metrics explorer**.
2. Click on **Select a metric**.
3. Select **Kubernetes Pod > Custom metrics > Web App - Active Users**.
4. Click **Apply**.
5. Click on **Save Chart**.
6. Give the new chart a name, such as **Active Users**.
7. Select **Container Dashboard** from the dashboards dropdown.
8. Click **Save Chart**.
9. Navigate back to your *Container* dashboard and click the **Gear** icons to display the settings menu.
10. Then click **Legends > Table** to display the text under each chart.
11. Click the three vertical bars next to the word **Value** at the right of each chart.

This displays a popup which contains the various labels which were  included in the timeSeries data sent by our application server. You can  use this information to filter or even aggregate the data in the chart.



## Creating alerts with Kubernetes Engine Monitoring

In this task, you will configure an alert within Kubernetes Engine  Monitoring and then use the dashboard to identify and respond to the  incident.

### Create an Alert Policy

You will now create an alert policy to detect high CPU utilization among the containers.

1. In the Cloud Console, from the **Navigation menu**, select **Monitoring > Detect >Alerting**.
2. Click **+ Create Policy**.
3. Click on **Select a metric** dropdown.
4. Uncheck the **Active** option.
5. Type **Kubernetes Container** in filter by resource and metric name.
6. Click on **Kubernetes Container > Container**.
7. Select **CPU request utilization**.
8. Click **Apply**. **Note:** If you cannot locate the **Kubernetes Container** resource type, you might have to refresh the page.
9. Set **Rolling windows** to 1 min.
10. Click **Next**.
11. Set Threshold position to **Above Threshold**.
12. Set **0.99** as your **Threshold value**.
13. Click **Next**.

### Respond to an Incident

Now, you will return to the monitoring dashboard where an incident is being reported on one of the containers.

1. In the Monitoring page, select **Overview** > **GKE**. On the Kubernetes Engine Monitoring dashboard, you should see an incident reported on the container.
2. In the **Containers** tab, click on the container name which shows the alert. It will take a minute or two to register the alert and you may need to refresh the page to see the alert.
3. Go to **Alerting** page.
4. Click the alert name **CPU request utilization** to view additional details.
5. Open the incident and click on the **Incident summary** entry.

7. Open the web interface for the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test tool.
8. In the **Generate CPU Load** section, click the **Stop CPU Load** button to resolve the issue by stopping the CPU Load Generator.
9. You may now close the GCP-GKE-Monitor-Test web browser window.
