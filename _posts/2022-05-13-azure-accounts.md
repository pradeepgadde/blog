# Azure Accounts
In this post, let us take a look into Azure Accounts. To create and use [Azure Services](https://pradeepgadde.com/blog/cloud/2022/05/13/tour-of-azure-services.html), we need a subscription.

To subscribe to Azure, we begin with creating an account. When we create an account, a subscription also gets created but we can create additional subscriptions later also.
Subscriptions help organize resource usage, for example, each department of a company may use a different subscription.

Once we create an account and subscription, we can start creating services or resources inside a resource group.

If you're new to Azure, you can sign up for a free account on the Azure website to start exploring at no cost to you. When you're ready, you can choose to upgrade your free account. You can create a new subscription that enables you to start paying for Azure services you need to use that are beyond the limits of a free account.

- Azure free Account: free for 12 months, credit to spend in first 30days, and free access to certain tools;

- Azure free student Account: same as free but for students, credit is valid for one year.
