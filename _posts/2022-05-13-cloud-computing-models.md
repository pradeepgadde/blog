# Cloud Computing Models

There are three cloud models:
- Public Cloud: services offered over internet, no capex, pay for what you use 
- Private Cloud: for one specific organization (internal use), complete control, hardware maintenance
- Hybrid Cloud: Combined use of Public and Private Clouds, more flexible

## Cloud Computing Advantages

- High Availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Agility
- Geo Distribution
- Disaster Recovery

## CapEx vs OpEx

CapEx requires significant up-front financial costs, as well as ongoing maintenance and support expenditures. By contrast, OpEx is a consumption-based model.

Cloud service providers operate on a *consumption-based model*, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for. A consumption-based model has many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs.
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest.
- The ability to pay for additional resources when they are needed.
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed.

## Cloud Service Models

- IaaS *Infrastructure-as-a-Service*

- PaaS *Platform-as-a-Service*

- SaaS *Software-as-a-Service*

The following diagram from Microsoft summarizes the three cloud service models.

## Serverless

*Serverless computing* is similar to PaaS. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs. Though the name says server less, there is a server running the applications, it is just that they are managed by the Cloud provider.
