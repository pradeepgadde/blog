# Ensure successful operation of a cloud solution

## Managing Compute Engine Resources

VM Images are of two types: Public and Custom
Custom images are only available to your project. These are the images you create from boot disks or other images.

You can create disk images from a persistent disk, snapshot of a persistent disk, another image in your project, an image that is shared from another project, a compressed raw image in Google Cloud storage.

Source options for creating an image:
- Disk
- Snapshot
- Image
- Cloud Storage file
- Virtual disk (VMDK, VHD)

Snapshots - are backups of persistent disks. Used to recover, transfer or make data accessible to toher resources in your project.
First one is a full snapshot and subsequent snapshots are incremental
Types:
- Snapshot (standard, separate location from your disk)
- Instant Snapshot (rapid restoration, same location as your disk)
- Archive Snapshot (long term storage, different location from your disk)

Snapshot schedules - create snapshots automatically
- hourly
- daily
- weekly

Storage of snapshots:
- Multi-regional
- Regional

Deletion rule:
- Keep snapshots
- Delete snapshots older than 14 days

Resizing a VM - If your VM does not have a local SSD, or is not part of a Manged Instance Group, you can change the machine type after stopping it.
