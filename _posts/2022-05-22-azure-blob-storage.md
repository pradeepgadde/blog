Azure Blob storage is an object storage solution.
It is unstructured, so any kind of data can be stored.
It can be reached from anywhere in the Internet.

It is not limited to common file formats.
It does not require developers to think about or manage disks;

Blob Storage is ideal for:
Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
Storing files for distributed access.
Streaming video and audio.
Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines.

You store blobs in containers, which helps you organize your blobs depending on your business needs.
