# Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
I had some experience with the AWS cloud, logged in to the console and created some resources and got some overall idea of how it would be to work in a cloud environment.
Few months ago, I wanted to learn the Cloud in a structured way and started with [Microsoft Azure Cloud Fundamentals course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/).

I have not taken the official certification yet, but I am planning to take it as soon as possible.
In preparation to achieving the Microsoft Certified Badge , I have started this notes preparation.



I have also enrolled in the [Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge May 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/cloudskillschallenge/build/thankyou/2022).

This is the first post in this series on Microsoft Azure Fundamentals.

To get a good introduction to the Cloud, we need to be familiar with the following topics.

- Azure Core Concepts
- Azure Core Services
- Core Solutions and Management Tools on Azure
- General security and Network Security features of Azure
- Identity, Governance, Privacy, and Compliance features of Azure
- Cost Management and Service Level Agreements of Azure

Microsoft is providing lot of useful resources on this topic for free. So I have registered in the Azure Fundamentals Learing Path and completed all the modules. 

In this series, I will be reviewing those modules again and make some notes.

Finally, to get the official badge, we need to appear for the Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals which costs $99 USD or â‚¹3696 INR* as on today.

This exam measures your ability to describe the following: 
- Cloud concepts; 
- Azure architecture and services; and 
- Azure management and governance.

This is just the beginning of a journey which is going to be amazing (i think!).

Here is the complete list of all [Azure Certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=certification&products=azure%2Csql-server&type=fundamentals%2Crole-based%2Cspecialty&expanded=azure%2Cwindows&WT.mc_id=Azure_BoM-wwl).

Let us begin our Cloud journey (officially!).
