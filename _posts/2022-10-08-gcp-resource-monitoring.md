# Resource Monitoring
Use Cloud Monitoring to gain insight into applications that run on Google Cloud.

- Explore Cloud Monitoring

- Add charts to dashboards

- Create alerts with multiple conditions

- Create resource groups

- Create uptime checks

## Task 1. Create a Cloud Monitoring workspace
Verify resources to monitor
Three VM instances have been created for you that you will monitor.

Create a Monitoring workspace
You will now setup a Monitoring workspace that's tied to your Google Cloud Project. The following steps create a new account that has a free trial of Monitoring.

## Task 2. Custom dashboards
Create a dashboard
