# Getting Started with AWS

## Overview of Amazon Web Services

In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web
services—now commonly known as cloud computing. Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security, and
enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. 

## Six advanatages of Cloud Computing

- Trade capital expense for variable expense
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Stop guessing capacity
- Increase speed and agility
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers 
- Go global in minutes

## Cloud Computing Models

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

## Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- Cloud
- Hybrid
- On-premises (Private cloud)

## Global Infrastructure

AWS serves over a million active customers in more than 240 countries and territories. The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. An AWS Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple Availability Zones. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. These Availability Zones offer you the ability to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. The AWS Cloud operates in 80 Availability Zones within 25 geographic Regions around the world, with announced plans for more Availability Zones and Regions.

## Security and Compliance

### Security

- Keep Your Data Safe

- Meet Compliance Requirements

- Save Money

- Scale quickly

### Compliance
The IT infrastructure that AWS provides to its customers is designed and managed in alignment with
best security practices and a variety of IT security standards. The following is a partial list of assurance
programs with which AWS complies:
• SOC 1/ISAE 3402, SOC 2, SOC 3
• FISMA, DIACAP, and FedRAMP
• PCI DSS Level 1
• ISO 9001, ISO 27001, ISO 27017, ISO 27018

 ## Amazon Web Services Cloud

- AWS Management Console
- AWS Command Line Interface
- Software Development Kits

## Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (24% of scored content)
### Define the benefits of the AWS Cloud
Value proposition of the AWS Cloud

• Understanding the economies of scale (for example, cost savings)
• Understanding the benefits of global infrastructure (for example, speed of deployment, global reach)
• Understanding the advantages of high availability, elasticity, and agility

### Identify design principles of the AWS Cloud
AWS Well-Architected Framework

• Understanding the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework (for example, operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, sustainability)
• Identifying differences between the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework

### Understand the benefits of and strategies for migration to the AWS Cloud
Cloud adoption strategies
Resources to support the cloud migration journey

• Understanding the benefits of the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF) (for example, reduced business risk; improved environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance; increased revenue; increased operational efficiency)
• Identifying appropriate migration strategies (for example, database replication, use of AWS Snowball)

### Understand concepts of cloud economics
Aspects of cloud economics
Cost savings of moving to the cloud

• Understanding the role of fixed costs compared with variable costs
• Understanding costs that are associated with on-premises environments
• Understanding the differences between licensing strategies (for example, Bring Your Own License [BYOL] model compared with included licenses)
• Understanding the concept of rightsizing
• Identifying benefits of automation (for example, provisioning and configuration management with AWS CloudFormation)
• Identifying managed AWS services (for example, Amazon RDS, Amazon Elastic Container Service [Amazon ECS], Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service [Amazon EKS], Amazon DynamoDB)
