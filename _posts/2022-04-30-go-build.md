# Go Build with Net package

The package `net` defines many types, functions and methods of use in Go network programming. The type IP is defined as an array of bytes

```go
type IP []byte
```

There are several functions to manipulate a variable of type IP, but you are likely to use only some of them in practice. For example, the function `ParseIP(String)` will take a dotted IPv4 address or a colon IPv6 address, while the IP method String will return a string. 

```go
pradeep:~$cat ip.go 
/* IP
 */

package main

import (
    "net"
    "os"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) != 2 {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Usage: %s ip-addr\n", os.Args[0])
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    name := os.Args[1]

    addr := net.ParseIP(name)
    if addr == nil {
        fmt.Println("Invalid address")
    } else {
        fmt.Println("The address is ", addr.String())
    }
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

So far we have been using `go run` to compile and run our `Go` code. 
```go
pradeep:~$go run ip.go 
Usage: /var/folders/cf/vzmh318x285f0c1sbsnm14m40000gn/T/go-build3102043780/b001/exe/ip ip-addr
exit status 1
```

```go
pradeep:~$go run ip.go ip 127.0.0.1
Usage: /var/folders/cf/vzmh318x285f0c1sbsnm14m40000gn/T/go-build1045950479/b001/exe/ip ip-addr
exit status 1
```
Lets build this time.

```go
pradeep:~$go build ip.go           
```
As a result of the `go build` command, we can see a new file with the name of the package.

```go
pradeep:~$ls -la | grep ip
-rwxr-xr-x   1 pradeep  staff  1997584 Apr 30 16:59 ip
-rw-r--r--   1 pradeep  staff      402 Apr 30 16:58 ip.go
pradeep:~$
```
Let us call this code `ip`

```go
pradeep:~$ip 127.0.0.1
zsh: command not found: ip
```
Indicate that we are referring to the `ip` in the current directory by using `./`

```go
pradeep:~$./ip 127.0.0.1
The address is  127.0.0.1
```

```go
pradeep:~$./ip 192.168.1.567
Invalid address
```

```go
pradeep:~$./ip 192.168.1.5  
The address is  192.168.1.5
```
An example IPv6 address

```go
pradeep:~$./ip 2003:abcd:ef::12
The address is  2003:abcd:ef::12
```



```go
pradeep:~$cat mask.go 
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    if len(os.Args) != 2 {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Usage: %s dotted-ip-addr\n", os.Args[0])
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    dotAddr := os.Args[1]

    addr := net.ParseIP(dotAddr)
    if addr == nil {
        fmt.Println("Invalid address")
        os.Exit(1)
    }
    mask := addr.DefaultMask()
    network := addr.Mask(mask)
    ones, bits := mask.Size()
    fmt.Println("Address is ", addr.String(),
        " Default mask length is ", bits,
        "Leading ones count is ", ones,
        "Mask is (hex) ", mask.String(),
        " Network is ", network.String())
    os.Exit(0)
}

```

```go
pradeep:~$go build mask.go 
```

```go
pradeep:~$./mask 192.168.1.5
Address is  192.168.1.5  Default mask length is  32 Leading ones count is  24 Mask is (hex)  ffffff00  Network is  192.168.1.0
```

```go
pradeep:~$./mask 10.20.30.5    
Address is  10.20.30.5  Default mask length is  32 Leading ones count is  8 Mask is (hex)  ff000000  Network is  10.0.0.0
```

```go
pradeep:~$./mask 172.16.1.5
Address is  172.16.1.5  Default mask length is  32 Leading ones count is  16 Mask is (hex)  ffff0000  Network is  172.16.0.0
```
