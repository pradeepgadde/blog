    - name: Lession 4 Working wiht Variables,Inclusions and Task Control, Facts
        - Highest level scope wins  Global, Play, Host
        - Global: command line or ansible.cfg file
        - Host: individula hosts or groups via inventory file
        - Playbook:
          - hosts: all
            vars: # keyword to define variables
              user: pradeep
              home: /home/pradeep
        - Variable files:
          - hosts: all
            vars_files: # keyword to specify exterbal variable files 
              - vars/users.yml
            
              # cat var/users.yml
              # user: pradeep
              # home: /home/pradeep
              # user: suma
              # home: /home/suma
        - Using variables 
        - tasks:
            - name : Creates the user {{ user }} 
              user:
                name: "{{ user }}" # if the variable is used as the first element , double quotes mandatory !

        - Importance of Project Directory wiht various files 
        - Host variables and Group variables
        # These may be defined in the inventory file, but that is deprecated
        # Recommended method to use group_vars and host_vars directories ...

        # [webservers]
        # server1.example.com

        # [webservers:vars] ## To define variables inside inventory file 
        # user=pradeep


        # Within the Project Directory , which contains the inventoru file create directories group_vars and host_vars

        # If we have a host group "webservers" defined in the inventory, 
        # create file with the same name "group_vars/webservers" and in this file, define the variable 

        # Similarly for individul hosts, create a file wiht the name of the host and put it in "host_vars"
        # for example, "host_vars/server1"

        # Variables can be overwritten from command line with -e "key=value" option to the ansible-playbook command 


        # (base) pradeep-mbp:Desktop pradeep$ tree vardemo/  #Project Directory
        # vardemo/
        # |-- group_vars
        # |   |-- ftpservers
        # |   `-- webservers
        # `-- inventory

        # 1 directory, 3 files

        # (base) pradeep-mbp:Desktop pradeep$ cat vardemo/inventory 
        # [webservers]
        # server1.exmaple.com
        # server2.example.com

        # [ftpservers]
        # server3.example.com
        # server4.example.com

        # A variable named "package" is defined which could be used in the respective playbooks as {{ package }}
        # (base) pradeep-mbp:Desktop pradeep$ cat vardemo/group_vars/ftpservers 
        # package: vsftp
        # (base) pradeep-mbp:Desktop pradeep$ cat vardemo/group_vars/webservers 
        # package: http
        # (base) pradeep-mbp:Desktop pradeep$ 



        # Arrays : Variables that define multiple values 
        - example array 
          users:
            pradeep:
              first_name: pradeep
              last_name: gadde
              home_dir: /home/pradeep
            suma:
              first_name: suma
              last_name: gadde
              home_dir: /home/suma

        # we may refer to these using the following syntax -  users.pradeep.first_name , users.suma.home_dir etc ..


        - Using Facts  # discovered information about a host, can be used as conditions to run specific tasks only when necessary
        # The "setup" module is used to gather facts
        - ansible server1.example.com -m setup

        # We can filter facts with -a 'filter=..'  Level 1 info
        - ansible server1.example.com -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_kernel'
        - ansible localhost -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_kernel'
          # [WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
          # localhost | SUCCESS => {
          #     "ansible_facts": {

          #     },
          #     "changed": false
          # }

        - Custom Facts : manually created by Admins
