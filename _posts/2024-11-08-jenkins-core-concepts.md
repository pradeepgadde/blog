## Jenkins

Getting started with Essentials of Jenkins.

- Jobs
- Builds
- Freestyle Project
- Pipelines
- Stages
- Nodes
- Plugins



## Continuous Integration

Main > Feature Branch A > Commit > Pull Request > Review Approve > Merge > Manual Deploy > Production

Main > Feature Branch B > Commit > Pull Request > Review Approve > Merge > Manual Deploy > Production



Without CI, testing typically occurs later in the development cycle, mostly after multiple merges

Deploying code to staging and production relies on manual processes

With Continuous Integration, 

- Unit Testing

- Dependecny Scan

- Build Artifact

- Code Scanning (Vulenrability scanning)

  

Main > Feature Branch A > Commit > Pull Request  > Review Approve > CI > Merge > CI > Manual Deploy > Production

Main > Feature Branch B > Commit > Pull Request > Review Approve > CI > Merge > CI > Manual Deploy > Production

## Continuous Deployment/ Continous Delivery

Main > Feature Branch A > Commit > Pull Request  > Review Approve > CI >  CD > Merge > CI > CD (Automatic Deployment) > Production

Main > Feature Branch B > Commit > Pull Request > Review Approve > CI  > CD > Merge > CI > CD (Automatic Deployment) > Production

In Continuous Delivery, manual approval required as a safety net before deploying (automatically) to Production.



## Jenkins Architecture

Controller Node

Worker Node

In basic deployments single node acting as both controller and worker nodes

In advanced deployments, separate controller and worker nodes (Linux/Windows)

Nodes communicate using SSH/JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol)

Executors

Agents

## Jenkins Installation

Requires JRE / JDK

Otherwise, installation fails with error : failed to find a valid java installation

JENKINS_HOME : /var/lib/jenkins

`java -version`

`systemctl status jenkins`

`/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

# macOS Installers for Jenkins LTS

Jenkins can be installed using the [ Homebrew ](https://brew.sh/) package manager. Homebrew formula: [ jenkins-lts ](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jenkins-lts) This is a package supported by a third party which may be not as  frequently updated as packages supported by the Jenkins project  directly.

Sample commands:

- Install the latest LTS version: `brew install jenkins-lts`
- Start the Jenkins service: `brew services start jenkins-lts`
- Restart the Jenkins service: `brew services restart jenkins-lts`
- Update the Jenkins version: `brew upgrade jenkins-lts`

After starting the Jenkins service, browse to http://localhost:8080 and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

```sh
(base) pradeep:~$pwd
/Users/pradeep
(base) pradeep:~$brew install jenkins-lts
==> Auto-updating Homebrew...
Adjust how often this is run with HOMEBREW_AUTO_UPDATE_SECS or disable with
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE. Hide these hints with HOMEBREW_NO_ENV_HINTS (see `man brew`).
==> Auto-updated Homebrew!
Updated 3 taps (hashicorp/tap, homebrew/core and homebrew/cask).
==> New Formulae
azqr                      kanata                    mkdocs-material           toml2json
decasify                  libtatsu                  pytest
==> New Casks
acronis-true-image-cleanup-tool    font-eldur                         lunatask
bobhelper                          font-recursive-desktop             neohtop
default-handler                    hyperconnect                       viz
djuced                             jet-pilot                          whimsical

==> jenkins-lts
Note: When using launchctl the port will be 8080.

To start jenkins-lts now and restart at login:
  brew services start jenkins-lts
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  /usr/local/opt/openjdk@21/bin/java -Dmail.smtp.starttls.enable\=true -jar /usr/local/opt/jenkins-lts/libexec/jenkins.war --httpListenAddress\=127.0.0.1 --httpPort\=8080

# Unlock Jenkins

To ensure Jenkins is securely set up by the administrator, a password has been written to the log ([not sure where to find it?](https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/find-jenkins-logs)) and this file on the server: 

```
/Users/pradeep/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Please copy the password from either location and paste it below.

```sh
(base) pradeep:~$cat /Users/pradeep/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

# Customize Jenkins

â€‹			Plugins extend Jenkins with additional features to support many different needs. 	

## Build Steps
