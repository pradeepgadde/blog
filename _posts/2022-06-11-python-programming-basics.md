Python is being used everywhere. While working in AWS, we work with `boto3`, in quantum computing, `qiskit`, and in IoT, we use `micropython` to control Micro Controllers, for web development we use `flask` or `django` and for mobile app development, we use `kivy`. For data sciense and AI/ML we use `Pytorch`, `TensorFlow`and for Big Data, we use `PySpark`. For DevOps, most of the tools such as `Ansible` use Python.
